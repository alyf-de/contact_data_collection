Keep track of your daily visitor count and let your employees enter **Contact Data** manually (you know, there will always be people without a smartphone):

View individual **Contact Data** and, if someone gets sick, see who was there at the same time:

See a **Report** of people who were there at a certain time:

And yes, you can also print that and hand it to your local health agency:

## Privacy

- You can configure how long you need to store the **Contact Data**. The default is 30 days. Records that are older than that are automatically deleted.
- You can add a checkbox to the **Web Form** to let visitors agree with your privacy policy. 
- You can add links to your imprint and privacy policy to the footer of the website.
